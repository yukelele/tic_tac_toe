A command-line game of "Tic Tac Toe" programmed usig C++ language. 

Issues:
1. When a player picks a number that has been marked, the game does not indicate
    any feedback and simplily skip that player's turn. 
2. When a player enters a character other than the integer 1..9, the system runs 
    into an infinite loop. 
3. The game should add an option to play again, and switches which player goes first.
